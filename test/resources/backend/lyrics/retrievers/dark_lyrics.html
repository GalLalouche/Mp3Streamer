<h3><a name="1">1. 6:00</a></h3><br />
<i>[Samples from the film "The Dead", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]</i> <br />
"Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."<br />
"And for what?"<br />
"Well, isn't it for the honor of God, Aunt Kate?"<br />
"I know all about the honor of God, Mary Jane."<br />
<br />
Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream<br />
Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop<br />
Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep<br />
And wood to chop before he sleeps<br />
<br />
I may never get over<br />
but never's better than now<br />
I've got bases to cover<br />
<br />
He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car<br />
It's nine o'clock but he can't get out<br />
He lights a cigarette<br />
and turns the music down<br />
but just can't seem to shake that sound<br />
<br />
Once I thought I'd get over<br />
but it's too late for me now<br />
I've got bases to cover<br />
<br />
Melody walks through the door<br />
and memory flies out the window<br />
and nobody knows what they want<br />
'til they finally let it all go<br />
<br />
The pain inside<br />
coming outside<br />
<br />
So many ways to drown a man<br />
So many ways to drag him down<br />
Some are fast and some take years and years<br />
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep<br />
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep<br />
<br />
I could never get over<br />
Is it too late for me now?<br />
Feel like blowing my cover<br />
<br />
Melody walks through the door<br />
and memory flies out the window<br />
and nobody knows what they want<br />
'til they finally let it all go<br />
<br />
But don't cut your losses too soon<br />
'cause you'll only be cutting your throat<br />
And answer a call while you still hear at all<br />
'cause nobody will if you won't<br />
<br />

<h3><a name="2">2. Caught In A Web</a></h3><br />
Silence disguised<br />
I watch you<br />
Show me the hurt<br />
that haunts you<br />
would you despise the thrill<br />
If all you hide were mine?<br />
<br />
I can't hold on any longer<br />
These feelings keep growing stronger<br />
Echoes that deafen the mind<br />
will bury my voice in their wake<br />
<br />
Caught in a Web<br />
Removed from the world<br />
Hanging on by a thread<br />
Spinning the lies<br />
devised in my head<br />
Caught in a Web refused by the world<br />
Hanging on by a thread<br />
Spinning a cage denied and misread<br />
<br />
I've seen the path<br />
the one you take<br />
shows the truth<br />
for you to make<br />
This turn of phrase<br />
we might not see<br />
is the thirst of desire<br />
found so easily<br />
<br />
Try to push me 'round<br />
the world some more<br />
And make me live in fear<br />
I bare all that I am<br />
made of now<br />
Attractive I don't care<br />
'Cause even when I danced with life<br />
no one was there to share<br />
<br />
Does this voice the wounds of your soul?<br />
Does this voice the wounds of your soul?<br />
<br />
Caught in a Web<br />
Removed from the world<br />
Hanging on by a thread<br />
Spinning the lies<br />
devised in my head<br />
<br />
Tried to live the life<br />
you live and saw<br />
It doesn't work for me<br />
I bare all that I am<br />
made of now<br />
Attractive, I can't be<br />
Inside the Dance of Life is one<br />
I'll never hold to me<br />
<br />
You can't heal the wounds of my soul.<br />
You can't heal the wounds of my soul.<br />
<br />
Caught in a Web<br />
Removed from the world<br />
Hanging on by a thread<br />
Spinning the lies<br />
devised in my head<br />
<br />
Caught in a Web<br />
Refused by the world<br />
Hanging on by a thread<br />
Spinning a cage<br />
Denied and misread<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="3">3. Innocence Faded</a></h3><br />
Animation<br />
breathes a cloudless mind<br />
Fascination<br />
leaves the doubting blind<br />
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead<br />
the faithful live Awake<br />
the rest remain misled<br />
<br />
Some will transcend spinning years<br />
One as if time disappears<br />
<br />
Innocence faded<br />
the mirror falls behind you<br />
Trinity jaded<br />
I break down walls to find you<br />
<br />
Callow and vain<br />
fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain<br />
Passionless stage<br />
Distant like brothers<br />
Wearing apathetic displays<br />
Sharing flesh like envy in cages<br />
Condescending<br />
Not intending to end<br />
<br />
Some will transcend spinning years<br />
One as if time disappears<br />
<br />
Innocence faded<br />
the mirror falls behind you<br />
Trinity jaded<br />
I break down walls to find you<br />
<br />
Beginnings get complicated<br />
the farther we progress<br />
Opinions are calculated<br />
Immune to openness<br />
<br />
Beyond the circle's edge<br />
We're driven by her blessings<br />
Forever hesitating<br />
Caught beneath the wheel<br />
<br />
Innocence faded<br />
the mirror falls behind you<br />
Cynically jaded<br />
The child will crawl to find you.<br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<h3><a name="5">5. Voices</a></h3><br />
'Love, just don't stare'<br />
He used to say to me<br />
every Sunday morning<br />
The spider in the window<br />
The angel in the pool<br />
The old man takes the poison<br />
Now the widow makes the rules<br />
<br />
'So speak, I'm right here'<br />
She used to say to me<br />
not a word, not a word<br />
Judas on the ceiling<br />
the Devil in my bed<br />
I guess Easter's never coming<br />
So I'll just wait inside my head<br />
<br />
Like a scream but sort of silent<br />
living off my nightmares<br />
<br />
Voices repeating me<br />
'Feeling threatened?<br />
We reflect your hopes and fears.'<br />
Voices discussing me<br />
'Others steal your thoughts<br />
they're not confined<br />
within your mind.'<br />
<br />
Thought disorder<br />
Dream control<br />
Now they read my mind on the radio<br />
But where was the Garden of Eden?<br />
<br />
I feel elated<br />
I feel depressed<br />
Sex is death, Death is sex<br />
Says it right here on my Crucifix<br />
<br />
Like a scream but sort of silent<br />
living off my nightmares<br />
<br />
Voices protecting me<br />
'Good behavior<br />
brings the Savior<br />
to his knees.'<br />
Voices rejecting me<br />
'Others steal your thoughts<br />
they're not confined<br />
to your own mind.'<br />
<br />
<i>[Dialogue by rap artist Prix-mo reading from the book "Cultural Revolution".]</i><br />
"I don't wanna be here, 'cause of my<br />
suffering, 'cause of my illness.<br />
Only love is worth having, only<br />
love is what matters, loving every <br />
people on equal terms. "<br />
"You've got to know who you're <br />
dealin' with because, like a stranger, <br />
a-heh, just might come in through<br />
here with a gun... and then, what <br />
would you do? (Heh.)"<br />
"Everything is immaterial..."<br />
"'n' you know that reality is immaterial."<br />
"This is not reality..."<br />
<br />
I'm kneeling on the floor<br />
staring at the wall<br />
like the spider in the window<br />
I wish that I could speak<br />
Is there fantasy in refuge?<br />
God in politicians?<br />
Should I turn on my religion?<br />
These demons in my head tell me to<br />
<br />
I'm lying here in bed<br />
Swear my skin is inside out<br />
Just another Sunday morning<br />
<br />
Seen my diary on the newsstand<br />
Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand<br />
It's a shame no one is praying<br />
'Cause these voices in my head<br />
keep saying...<br />
<br />
'Love, just don't stare.'<br />
'Reveal the Word when you're<br />
supposed to'<br />
Withdrawn and introverted<br />
Infectiously perverted<br />
'Being laughed at and confused<br />
keeps us pleasantly amused<br />
enough to stay.'<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting<br />
Twentieth century Icon bleeding<br />
Willing to risk Salvation<br />
to escape from isolation<br />
<br />
I'm witness to redemption<br />
heard you speak but never listened<br />
Can you rid me of my secrets?<br />
Deliver us from Darkness?<br />
<br />
Voices repeating me<br />
'Feeling threatened?<br />
We reflect your hopes and fears.'<br />
Voices discussing me<br />
Don't expect your own Messiah<br />
This neverworld which you desire<br />
is only in your mind.<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="6">6. The Silent Man</a></h3><br />
A question well served,<br />
'Is silence like a fever?'<br />
'A voice never heard?'<br />
'Or a message with no receiver?'<br />
<br />
Pray they won't ask<br />
Behind the stained glass<br />
There's always one more mask<br />
<br />
Has man been a victim<br />
of his woman, of his father?<br />
if he elects not to bother,<br />
will he suffocate their faith?<br />
<br />
Desperate to fall<br />
Behind the Great Wall<br />
That separates us all<br />
<br />
When there is reason<br />
Tonight I'm Awake<br />
when there's no answer<br />
Arrive the Silent Man<br />
<br />
If there is balance<br />
tonight He's Awake<br />
If they have to suffer<br />
There lies the Silent Man<br />
<br />
Sin without deceivers<br />
A God with no believers<br />
I could sail by<br />
on the Winds of Silence<br />
And maybe they won't notice<br />
But this time I think<br />
It'd be better if I swim<br />
<br />
When there is reason<br />
Tonight I'm Awake<br />
When there's no answer<br />
Arrive the Silent Man<br />
If there is balance<br />
Tonight he's Awake<br />
But if they have to suffer<br />
There lies the Silent Man<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="7">7. The Mirror</a></h3><br />
Temptation-<br />
Why won't you leave me alone?<br />
Lurking Every Corner, everywhere I go<br />
<br />
Self Control-<br />
Don't turn your back on me now<br />
When I need you the most<br />
<br />
Constant pressure tests my will<br />
My will or my won't<br />
My Self Control escapes from me still...<br />
<br />
Hypocrite-<br />
How could you be so cruel<br />
and expect my faith in return?<br />
<br />
Resistance-<br />
Is not as hard as it seems<br />
When you close the door<br />
<br />
I spent so long trusting in you<br />
I trust you forgot<br />
Just when I thought I believed in you...<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample is Meryl Streep from the film "Falling In Love".]</i><br />
"What're you doing? <br />
What're you doing?"<br />
<br />
It's time for me to deal<br />
Becoming all too real<br />
living in fear-<br />
Why did you lie and pretend?<br />
This has come to an end<br />
I'll never trust you again<br />
It's time you made your amends<br />
Look in the mirror my friend<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]</i><br />
"That I haven't behaved as I should"<br />
<i>[Sample is Mary Beth Hurt from the film "Light Sleeper".]</i><br />
"Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you."<br />
<i>[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]</i><br />
"I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things you can't control."<br />
<br />
Let's stare the problem right in the eye<br />
It's plagued me from coast to coast<br />
Racing the clock to please everyone<br />
All but the one who matters the most<br />
<br />
Reflections of reality<br />
are slowly coming into view<br />
How in the hell could you possibly forgive me?<br />
After all the hell I put you through<br />
<br />
It's time for me to deal<br />
Becoming all too real<br />
living in fear-<br />
Why'd I betray my friend?<br />
Lying until the end<br />
Living life so pretend<br />
It's time to make my amends<br />
I'll never hurt you again<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="8">8. Lie</a></h3><br />
Daybreak<br />
at the bottom of lake<br />
it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe<br />
And I won't get out<br />
'til I figure it out<br />
Though I'm weak like I can't believe<br />
So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you<br />
Just let me show you<br />
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt<br />
'cause I don't know if I know you<br />
<br />
Doing fine but don't waste my time<br />
Tell me what it is you want to say<br />
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry<br />
I've been out in the rain all day<br />
So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you<br />
as far as I can throw you<br />
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt<br />
'cause I don't know if I know you<br />
<br />
Don't tell me you wanted me<br />
Don't tell me you thought of me<br />
I won't, I swear I won't<br />
(Did)<br />
I'll try, I swear I'll try<br />
(Lie)<br />
<br />
Mother Mary quite contrary<br />
Kiss the boys and make them wary<br />
Things are getting just a little bit scary<br />
It's a wonder I can still breathe<br />
<br />
Never been much of a doubting Thomas<br />
but nothing breaks like a broken promise<br />
You tell me 'bout your two more coming<br />
but once is just enough for me<br />
<br />
Don't tell me you wanted me<br />
Don't tell me you thought of me<br />
I won't, I swear I won't (did)<br />
I'll try, I swear I'll try (lie)<br />
<br />
I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed<br />
She comes in apparently to fill the void<br />
All dogs need a leash and<br />
at least I'll forget it<br />
And she would never hurt me though<br />
she's never said it<br />
But I'm not gonna ask her today<br />
I don't wanna scare her away<br />
Your town, I'm all alone<br />
and I just can't stare at the phone<br />
I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes<br />
and you can tell your stepfather I said so<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="9">9. Lifting Shadows Off A Dream</a></h3><br />
He seems alone and silent<br />
thoughts remain without an answer<br />
Afraid and uninvited<br />
he slowly drifts away<br />
<br />
Moved by desire and fear<br />
Breaking delicate wings<br />
<br />
Lifting shadows<br />
off a Dream once broken<br />
She can turn a drop of water<br />
Into an ocean<br />
<br />
As the rain is pouring down<br />
Tears of sorrow wash his mind<br />
Drifting with the current<br />
This stream of life flows on<br />
<br />
He seems alone and silent<br />
waiting on his hands and knees<br />
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly<br />
<br />
Moved by desire and fear<br />
he takes a few steps away<br />
<br />
Lifting shadows<br />
off a Dream once broken<br />
She can turn a drop of water<br />
Into an ocean<br />
<br />
And she listens openly<br />
<br />
He pours his soul into the water<br />
reflecting the mystery<br />
She carries him away<br />
and the winds die slowly<br />
<br />
And she listens openly<br />
And she listens openly<br />
<br />
Lifting shadows<br />
off a Dream once broken<br />
She can turn a drop of water<br />
Into an ocean<br />
<br />
Lifting Shadows off a Dream<br />
Lifting Shadows off a Dream<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="10">10. Scarred</a></h3><br />
To Rise, To Fall.<br />
To Hurt, To Hate.<br />
To Want, To Wait.<br />
To Heal, To Save.<br />
<br />
Can't hear it<br />
we fear it<br />
awareness won't come near it<br />
<br />
Distractive<br />
Reactive<br />
Disguised in spite of time<br />
<br />
I never bared my emotion<br />
My passion always strong<br />
I never lost my devotion<br />
but somewhere fate went wrong<br />
<br />
Can't let them rape me again<br />
Your venom's not family here<br />
won't let them fill me with<br />
fatalistic remedies<br />
<br />
What if the rest of the world<br />
was hopelessly blinded by fear?<br />
Where would my sanctity live?<br />
Suddenly nobody cares.<br />
<br />
It's never enough<br />
You're wasting your time<br />
Isn't there something I could say?<br />
You don't understand<br />
You're closing me out<br />
How can we live our lives this way?<br />
<br />
You tell me I'm wrong<br />
I'm risking my life<br />
Still, I have nothing in return<br />
I show you my hands<br />
You don't see the scars<br />
Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.<br />
<br />
What if the rest of the world<br />
was hopelessly drowning in vain?<br />
Where would our self pity run?<br />
Suddenly everyone cares.<br />
<br />
Blood...Heal me<br />
Fear...Change me<br />
Belief will always save me<br />
Blood...Swearing<br />
Fear...Staring<br />
Conviction made aware<br />
<br />
Give up on misery<br />
Turn your back on dissent<br />
Leave their distrust behind<br />
Wash your hands of regret<br />
<br />
Do you feel you don't know me anymore?<br />
And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?<br />
And how come you don't want me asking?<br />
And how come my heart's not invited?<br />
You say you want everyone happy<br />
Well, we're not laughing.<br />
<br />
And how come you don't understand me?<br />
And how come I don't understand you?<br />
Thirty years say we're in this together<br />
So open your eyes.<br />
<br />
People in prayer for me<br />
everyone there for me<br />
Sometimes I feel I should face this alone<br />
My soul exposed<br />
It calms me to know that I won't<br />
<br />
Blood...Heal me<br />
Fear...Change me<br />
Belief will always save me<br />
Blood...Swearing<br />
Fear...Staring<br />
Conviction made aware<br />
<br />
Give up on misery<br />
Turn your back on dissent<br />
Leave their distrust behind<br />
Wash your hands of regret<br />
<br />
Blood...Heal me<br />
Fear...Change me<br />
Belief will always save me<br />
Blood...Swearing<br />
Fear...Staring<br />
Conviction made aware<br />
<br />
Learning from misery<br />
Staring back at dissent<br />
Leaving distrust behind<br />
I'm inspired and content<br />

Feeling my heart pull west<br />
I saw the future dressed as a stranger<br />
love in a space-dye vest<br />
<br />
Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding<br />
a pool in the shape of a heart<br />
Beauty projection in the reflection<br />
Always the worst way to start<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".]</i><br />
"But he's the sort who can't know<br />
anyone intimately, least of all a<br />
woman. He doesn't know what a woman<br />
is. He wants you for a possession, <br />
something to look at like a painting or an ivory box. <br />
Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real, <br />
or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you. <br />
I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and <br />
feelings, even when<br />
I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our <br />
last chance..."<br />
<br />
Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it<br />
Learning to swallow the rage<br />
Found a new girl I think we can make it<br />
as long as she stays on the page<br />
<br />
This is not how I want it to end<br />
And I'll never be open again<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]</i><br />
"...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,<br />
get a job, get my own place, ummm, <br />
but... I go into the mall where I<br />
want to work and they tell me, I'm, <br />
I was too young..."<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample is Jim Hill from a news commentary about the OJ Simpson freeway chase.]</i><br />
"Some people, gave advice before,<br />
about facing the facts, about<br />
facing reality. And this is, this<br />
without a doubt, is his biggest <br />
challenge ever. He's going to have to face it. <br />
You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and, <br />
uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can <br />
say they know how he feels."<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.]</i><br />
"That, so they say that, in ya know<br />
like, Houston or something, you'd<br />
say it's a hundred and eighty degrees, <br />
but it's a dry heat.<br />
In Houston they say that?<br />
Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.<br />
Dry until they hit the swimming pool."<br />
<br />
<i>[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]</i><br />
"...I get up with the sun... Listen.<br />
You have your own room to sleep in,<br />
I don't care what you do. I don't<br />
care when. That door gets locked, <br />
that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock. <br />
If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd <br />
better find some <br />
place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in <br />
this house. <br />
Supper is ready..."<br />
<br />
There's no one to take my blame<br />
if they wanted to<br />
There's nothing to keep me sane<br />
and it's all the same to you<br />
There's nowhere to set my aim<br />
so I'm everywhere<br />
Never come near me again<br />
do you really think I need you<br />
<br />
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.<br />
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.<br />
<br />
And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend<br />
And I'll never be open again<br />
And I'll have no more dreams to defend<br />
And I'll never be open again<br />
<br /><br />
