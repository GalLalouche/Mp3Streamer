Daybreak<br>
at the bottom of lake<br>
it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe<br>
And I won't get out<br>
'til I figure it out<br>
Though I'm weak like I can't believe<br>
So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you<br>
Just let me show you<br>
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt<br>
'cause I don't know if I know you<br>
<br>
Doing fine but don't waste my time<br>
Tell me what it is you want to say<br>
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry<br>
I've been out in the rain all day<br>
So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you<br>
as far as I can throw you<br>
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt<br>
'cause I don't know if I know you<br>
<br>
Don't tell me you wanted me<br>
Don't tell me you thought of me<br>
I won't, I swear I won't<br>
(Did)<br>
I'll try, I swear I'll try<br>
(Lie)<br>
<br>
Mother Mary quite contrary<br>
Kiss the boys and make them wary<br>
Things are getting just a little bit scary<br>
It's a wonder I can still breathe<br>
<br>
Never been much of a doubting Thomas<br>
but nothing breaks like a broken promise<br>
You tell me 'bout your two more coming<br>
but once is just enough for me<br>
<br>
Don't tell me you wanted me<br>
Don't tell me you thought of me<br>
I won't, I swear I won't (did)<br>
I'll try, I swear I'll try (lie)<br>
<br>
I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed<br>
She comes in apparently to fill the void<br>
All dogs need a leash and<br>
at least I'll forget it<br>
And she would never hurt me though<br>
she's never said it<br>
But I'm not gonna ask her today<br>
I don't wanna scare her away<br>
Your town, I'm all alone<br>
and I just can't stare at the phone<br>
I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes<br>
and you can tell your stepfather I said so<br>
