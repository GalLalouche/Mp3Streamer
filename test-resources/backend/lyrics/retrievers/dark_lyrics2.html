<h3><a name="1">1. Kaedit Nos Pestis</a></h3><br />
Desecrators, here's our warning<br />
You tamed like a sheep and chained up like a dog<br />
You will never stand long, our justice will be done<br />
You will never stand long, there is nowhere to run<br />
<br />
Don't let them pave your way<br />
Don't let them stand on your way<br />
Don't let them hear what you say<br />
Don't let them judge your day<br />
<br />
You burned your book, soon you will burn yourself<br />
You spiitted on your grave dug by slaves<br />
You set a fire on your puny soul<br />
You set a fire with your filthy blood<br />
<br />
Don't let them steal your wrath<br />
Don't let them feel your wrath<br />
Don't let them guide your path<br />
Don't let them light your path<br />
<br />
Lost on your way to the dark<br />
Your pain is all we see<br />
Don't you ever play with fire<br />
We were born in hell<br />
<br />
We stand with our pride, our forces you'll never see<br />
Now leave, the feeble filled with lies<br />
With our black hammer we will smash your dream<br />
Now leave, the feeble with no faith<br />
<br />
Don't let them count your sins<br />
Don't let them count you in<br />
Don't let them rape your soul<br />
Don't let them reap your soul<br />
<br />
Lost on your way to the dark<br />
You'll be cursed for eternity<br />
No time to beg, no mercy given<br />
We were born in hell<br />
<br />
Faithless believers<br />
Drown in your weakness<br />
Shameless deceivers<br />
Drown in your greed<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="2">2. Graveward</a></h3><br />
With the sleepless shadows behind my back<br />
I walk to the grave soon to be forgotten<br />
I signed my name in blood so black<br />
How long this road could be I do not know<br />
<br />
My fear my sorrow<br />
The path I have to follow<br />
With all of my hope<br />
Which once I did know<br />
<br />
I'm not brave enough to deny what they have said to me<br />
I'm not brave enough to doubt<br />
I'm not brave<br />
No I am not<br />
<br />
Will you choose to believe their lies?<br />
Knowing that their lies are old<br />
Let me tell you, I'll choose to close my eyes<br />
So that I don't have to see the truth<br />
<br />
Graveward I'll walk in despair<br />
Only the dark shall be my prayer<br />
Feel your dark and feel your breath<br />
Feel your dark and feel your death<br />
<br />
Millions of lies are in my eyes<br />
A death to die, I will die my death<br />
Millions of dreams waiting to be lost<br />
A death to die, I will die my death<br />
<br />
The tamed sheep, their souls to reap<br />
Like a one night dream so vague as it seems<br />
My grief in blood that is running so deep<br />
For us the meek, There will be no relief<br />
<br />
Tears drop on the road paved with lies<br />
The road once I thought paved with hopes<br />
The tomb they discard, the bell of doom they ring<br />
It blooms but soon to be withering<br />
<br />
Graveward leads my path<br />
Graveward I'm walking alone<br />
Graveward leads my path<br />
Graveward I'll be gone<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="3">3. The Tombfiller</a></h3><br />
So many signs, the symbols of your end<br />
You may have not noticed but here I am<br />
I have been always with you since your birth<br />
A birth of death, a birth to be cursed<br />
You fear the night, now you fear the light<br />
The light that blinds your innocent eyes<br />
After your're gone, nothing will remain<br />
Even your death shall perish in flame<br />
<br />
Die, die, die, I'm a bringer of your fear<br />
Die, die, die, my intention is clear<br />
Die, die, die, you may die twice<br />
But this is the first death you will die<br />
Remember my  name, I'm a bringer of your disaster<br />
Remember my face, It's time to face your master<br />
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see<br />
So many times you have seen me<br />
<br />
You know my name, you've heard my voice<br />
You have seen me, you have seen what I did<br />
But you don't know my face<br />
Although you think you know it<br />
It's too late to pray, too late to be saved<br />
After your body rises from the grave<br />
I am your curse, a curse on your birth<br />
You should know I have been always with you<br />
Once you're buried, there'll be no rebirth<br />
<br />
Die, die, die, your time is running out<br />
Die, die, die, as destined from the start<br />
Die, die, die, your world to fall apart<br />
After you're gone, nothing will remain<br />
<br />
Ghosts around you, they died in scorching fire<br />
Burned, burned, burned to death on funeral pyre<br />
Once you're chosen, there will be no escape,<br />
Your soul is taken, it will never be the same<br />
<br />
The souls set free to rest in peace<br />
The souls set free to be served as my feast<br />
The hungry children I will feed<br />
I'll come from behind when you expect the least<br />
The souls set free to rest in peace<br />
The souls set free to be served as my feast<br />
The hungry children I will feed<br />
I'll come from behind when you are blind<br />
<br />
Let me be your eternal bride<br />
Let me be your light so bright<br />
Let me be your eyes inside<br />
Let me be your fear in sight<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="4">4. The Forlorn</a></h3><br />
My face so pale<br />
My eyes so stale<br />
My body so thin<br />
My skin so grim<br />
<br />
Can't you see me?<br />
I'm standing here<br />
Or can't you hear me?<br />
I'm screaming out so loud<br />
<br />
Lying on the bed<br />
With the sign of the dead<br />
Where am I?<br />
People are weeping but why?<br />
Who am I to see me die<br />
Who am I to see them cry<br />
<br />
Can't you see me?<br />
I'm standing here<br />
Or can't you hear me?<br />
I'm screaming out so loud<br />
I remember the nothing<br />
I remember not a thing<br />
What's happened to me?<br />
What's happened to my body?<br />
<br />
I am not dead!<br />
My hearbeat still...<br />
I am not dead!<br />
I am here, I am gazing at myself<br />
I am not dead!<br />
<br />
Storms in my head<br />
Oh if I am dead<br />
Who am I to see me<br />
Lying on the bed<br />
I'm so cold, I am freezing in the dark<br />
I'm so cold, I am shaking in the dark<br />
<br />
Chained, maimed, tamed, and enslaved<br />
<br />
My fading words, can't you hear<br />
Yes it's me, I am here<br />
I'm so cold, save my soul<br />
Hear my plea, Save me please<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="5">5. The Molesters Of My Soul</a></h3><br />
Will you save me from this nightmare<br />
With your blood-covered salvation<br />
With your Revelation covered with blood<br />
With your blood black and blessed<br />
<br />
Am I god or am I not<br />
It doesn't matter I'm destined to rot<br />
Am I god or am I not<br />
I'm going to lose all I have got<br />
<br />
Molesters, molesters<br />
Molesters of my soul<br />
They won't rest my soul<br />
They molest my soul<br />
Please rest my soul you stole<br />
(I was) born cursed<br />
To die blessed<br />
(I was) born blind<br />
To die in bliss<br />
<br />
Your hands are red, as red as my blood<br />
But your blood is black<br />
Black and blessed<br />
Don't you ever learn?<br />
Into the flame I'll return<br />
As I have no eyes to see<br />
I'll be your servant<br />
<br />
I am a holder of your fate<br />
I am a bringer of your hate<br />
I am a savior, I am a messiah<br />
I am a bringer to the scorching fire<br />
To cleanse your soul<br />
<br />
See the Angels with their eyes closed fall<br />
See the Angels with their wings torn fall<br />
See the old tombs waiting to be filled<br />
<br />
I know not when<br />
I know not where<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="6">6. Out Of The Grave</a></h3><br />
Surrounded by darkness and nothing I can see<br />
No light, so night, but I know where I am<br />
Hard to breathe, hard to scream<br />
Lying in the coffin<br />
Hard to breathe, hard to scream<br />
I can hardly move<br />
<br />
A smell of blood, a smell of death<br />
Fear starts to grow inside, I had to hold my breath<br />
A Fear of torment with a fear of death<br />
I know death comes so slow, it's the second death<br />
<br />
Out of the grave I must get<br />
Out of the grave but it's too late<br />
Out of the grave I must get<br />
Out of the grave but I see no way<br />
<br />
I'm choking on this fear, I'll die blind<br />
Without being noticed<br />
I'm going out of my mind<br />
I hear the dead calling my name but what can I do?<br />
I hear the dead calling my name, they're whispering to me<br />
<br />
I'm gasping, but no one will hear me<br />
I'm gasping, but no one will save me<br />
I'm losing my sanity<br />
I feel the dead wait for me<br />
<br />
No hope is left<br />
No time is left<br />
Only a slow death I have to die awaits<br />
So slow and so cruel, and it's full of pain<br />
I just cannot stay sane<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="7">7. The Trial By The Dead</a></h3><br />
Since I have tasted the thing called wisdom<br />
Since I have touched the truth<br />
Since I have met my destiny<br />
My fear keeps growing inside of me<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that my eyes were shut<br />
Before my time is through<br />
Like plagues silently it spread<br />
It will choke me until I'm dead<br />
<br />
I'm on my own<br />
So far away I have come<br />
<br />
When I reached the land of bliss<br />
The gate was already closed<br />
Of Father Time, why don't you just let me walk out of this?<br />
Why are you so cruel to me?<br />
<br />
Since I have opened my eyes<br />
Since I have stopped covering my ears<br />
Since I have discarded my disguise<br />
All I can do is breeding my fears<br />
<br />
I stand all alone<br />
So far away I had to come<br />
<br />
I've been keeping walking alone<br />
I know I have come too far<br />
I've been keeping walking alone<br />
I know there's no turning back<br />
<br />
I live in a dream<br />
Then I die in a dream<br />
<br />
Do you know why I had to welcome my demons<br />
With those dreams to be gone<br />
Do you know why I had to welcome my demons<br />
With those fears to be gone<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="8">8. The Casketburner</a></h3><br />
Only the world within me changed<br />
Nothing else, they all are the same<br />
The sentence is death<br />
It's the end of the game<br />
The sentence is death<br />
It's the end of my fame<br />
<br />
Why me? Was it meant to be?<br />
Remains with no soul is all I see<br />
Please forgive my sins<br />
All of my sins<br />
Before my time in hell begins<br />
<br />
My blood is running slow<br />
Please don't let me go<br />
But God told me so<br />
The graves are vacant now<br />
<br />
My casket burns<br />
My casket burns<br />
My casket burns<br />
You watch it burn<br />
<br />
My prayer won't be heard<br />
<br />
Is this the silence I've been looking for<br />
Is this the darkness I've been looking for<br />
All the walls are now painted black<br />
To show them that I was once alive<br />
<br />
No one else feels my pain<br />
Some day you will see<br />
No one else feels my pain<br />
You will see that you're the same<br />
<br />
Why me? Was it meant to be?<br />
Remains with no soul is all I see<br />
Into the swamp my soul will sink<br />
Wait for me, I need time to think<br />
<br />
I did not want to know<br />
I did not want to know<br />
I did not want to know<br />
The graves are vacant now<br />
<br />
The Casketburner lights my casket<br />
The Casketburner, the fate to met<br />
The Casketburner, the fire to be set<br />
The Casketburner burns my casket<br />
Burn in this flame, turn in your grave<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="9">9. A Messenger From Tomorrow</a></h3><br />
<i>[I. The Message]</i><br />
<br />
Pray for my soul<br />
Then hang me please<br />
Pray for my soul<br />
Then angels weep<br />
<br />
Who's to blame when it's all the same<br />
Remember I'm not the only one to warn you<br />
Behind the light, Crawls the night<br />
I live like the dead then die like the living<br />
<br />
What do you mean when you say you fear your fate?<br />
What do you mean when you say you know it's too late?<br />
<br />
I am so cold<br />
<br />
Will you fear the day to come?<br />
In the end blind I'll become<br />
Will you fear the day to come?<br />
In the end blind I'll become<br />
<br />
Death is empty, Death is filthy<br />
Death is cold, Death is somber<br />
Death is eternal, Death is certain<br />
Now the circle is closed<br />
I wish I was innocent enough to believe in such a fantasy<br />
I wish I was tamed enough to be pleased to keep living in this cage<br />
<br />
I feel cold...<br />
<br />
<i>[II. Foreboding ]</i><br />
<br />
<i>[Instrumental]</i><br />
<br />
<i>[III. Doomsday]</i><br />
<br />
Will you fear the day to come?<br />
In the end blind I'll become<br />
Like I was warned<br />
What will it be?<br />
How will it be?<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="10">10. Dwellers In A Dream</a></h3><br />
Woke up in a dream and I'm still in a dream<br />
I'll never get out anyway<br />
(I was) born in a dream then I live in a dream<br />
(I'll) die in a dream any day<br />
Please wait for me until I am ready<br />
Ready to face the fate which I have to face<br />
Please wait for me until I am ready<br />
Ready to chase the fate which I have to chase<br />
<br />
Into the pit of hell I'll fall<br />
Lost is my glory still I recall<br />
Into the pit of hell I'll fall<br />
All of my pains I'll take them all<br />
<br />
Let me out, Out of this dream<br />
Let me out, I am living in<br />
Let me out, I wish I had known that<br />
I'd be a dweller in my own dream<br />
<br />
Let me out, Out of this dream<br />
Let me out, I am living in<br />
Let me out, I have to let it done<br />
But when I'm out, this world shall perish<br />
<br />
Am I living in a dream or am I just dreaming<br />
It does not matter as it's the same anyway<br />
When I die in a dream, the dream will die<br />
I can kill the dream, yes any day<br />
The end of this dream is the end of this world<br />
Destined to perish, destined to be forgotten<br />
Before we see who the dreamer is<br />
Before we see who the believers are<br />
<br />
Let me out, Out of this dream<br />
Let me out, I am living in<br />
Let me out, I wish I had know that<br />
I'd be a dweller in my own dream<br />
<br />
Let me out, Out of this dream<br />
Let me out, I am living in<br />
Let me out, I have to let it done<br />
I will take the whole world with me<br />
