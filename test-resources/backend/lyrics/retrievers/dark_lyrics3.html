<h3><a name="1">1. Neo Aeon (Intro)</a></h3><br />
<i>[instrumental]</i><br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="2">2. Lady Temptress</a></h3><br />
Lady Temptress<br />
Lucifer's daughter<br />
Born in my flesh<br />
Arise and be revealed<br />
<br />
Unknown for the corrupted minds<br />
She dwells in malignancy<br />
In the distant crypts of your inner self<br />
Where Man of God doesn't seek<br />
<br />
Please don't leave me Lady Temptress<br />
Revel in my body Lady Temptress<br />
<br />
Lady Temptress<br />
Meet me in my dreams<br />
Trace my dark sides<br />
In the depth of my subconscious<br />
<br />
Open the door<br />
To the slumbering sinner<br />
Rule my evil thoughts<br />
And let them all out<br />
<br />
Please don't leave me Lady Temptress<br />
Revel in my body Lady Temptress<br />
<br />
Lady Temptress<br />
You are the blood of Man<br />
The remedy to hypocrisy<br />
Please stay alive<br />
<br />
You keep my desires unlocked<br />
And my desires breed in you<br />
The Lady of temptation<br />
Hails the human nature<br />
<br />
Please don't leave me Lady Temptress<br />
Revel in my body Lady Temptress<br />
I beg on my knees<br />
Make love to me one more time<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="3">3. Mountain Of Doom</a></h3><br />
Evil imaginations of a time to come<br />
Dreamly dead - Almost gone<br />
Nocturnal visits from the beyond<br />
I will travel down the Mountain of Doom<br />
<br />
At the highest point visible<br />
I behold the sun for the very last time<br />
I see an awful sight with awful beings<br />
As the sun goes down behind the Mountain of Doom<br />
<br />
The Mountain of Doom<br />
Has taken my life<br />
<br />
Almost there<br />
Trying to seize my mind<br />
Still aware<br />
Of their seek and find<br />
<br />
I have lost hold of myself<br />
Taken to the extent of my life<br />
Eternal sleep in a dreamworld's coffin<br />
Entombed beneath the Mountain of Doom<br />
<br />
The Mountain of Doom<br />
Has taken my life<br />
<br />
Almost there<br />
Trying to seize my mind<br />
Still aware<br />
Of their seek and find<br />
<br />
Now I'm there<br />
Enjoying my peace of mind<br />
In this lair<br />
Death is what you'll find<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="4">4. Dead Boys' Quire</a></h3><br />
Hallowed dances upon glorified graves<br />
Twisted minds, blasphemous slaves<br />
Witches and demons are supporting the dead<br />
In worship of who they are lead<br />
<br />
Views of midnightly risen stones<br />
Sounds of clattering skulls and bones<br />
Like shadows they cling tight onto trees<br />
Proud of their evilness, they are God's enemies<br />
<br />
They are gathered here in the fivepointed star<br />
To close up ritual of a time so far<br />
End what was not ended before<br />
To meet the lord Satan they highly adore<br />
<br />
The Dead Boy's Choir whispers through the eternal fire<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="5">5. Sumerian Cry (Part III)</a></h3><br />
Nailed to a pleasant sleep<br />
Under the fullmoon light<br />
Calculated ancient knowledge<br />
Of Arab's wise words<br />
<br />
I dreamed about a temple<br />
I saw it in my dreams<br />
A temple made of silver<br />
With emeralds above<br />
<br />
It is in the wood<br />
Spoken by animal lips<br />
My seal and my epitaph<br />
It is the Sumerian Cry<br />
<br />
I visited the temple<br />
In my imaginations it welcomed my<br />
I tried to understand the language<br />
And the sumerian cuneiform<br />
<br />
I read about their gods<br />
And in my dreams they spoke to me<br />
They showed me the tablets of fate<br />
Which since a battle belong to them<br />
<br />
It is in the wood<br />
Spoken by animal lips<br />
My seal and my epitaph<br />
It is the Sumerian Cry<br />
<br />
Then I saw the Ancient Ones<br />
Slumbering in their cave<br />
My dreams and my nightmares<br />
The liers in wait bred my fear<br />
<br />
I woke up from my dreams<br />
The night had become day<br />
Highly strung, rigid and struck<br />
I peered through the morning fog<br />
<br />
It is in the wood<br />
Spoken by animal lips<br />
My seal and my epitaph<br />
It is the Sumerian Cry<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="6">6. On Golden Wings</a></h3><br />
People! This is my world<br />
You are just parts of it<br />
If I would have been a big tree<br />
The you would have been the fruits of by boughs<br />
<br />
But join me<br />
We're all kings<br />
Don't fear for your insanity<br />
Fly on its wings<br />
<br />
Take my wings and rely on them in battle and fight<br />
Fly on my dreams in the darkest of nights<br />
Put those wings of gold to the fear of your dreams<br />
And notice that what scares you is not always what it seems<br />
<br />
In the end fruit always fall to the ground<br />
And new flowers soon blossom<br />
When watching you rise and fall<br />
My limbs proudly extend you above<br />
<br />
So join me<br />
We're all kings<br />
Don't fear for your insanity<br />
Fly on its wings<br />
<br />
Take my wings and rely on them in battle and fight<br />
Fly on my dreams in the darkest of nights<br />
Put those wings of gold to the fear of your dreams<br />
And notice that what scares you is not always what it seems<br />
<br />
In the end fruit always fall to the ground<br />
And new flowers soon blossom<br />
When watching your rise and fall<br />
My limbs proudly extend you above<br />
<br />
So join me<br />
We're all kings<br />
Don't fear for your insanity<br />
Fly on its wings<br />
<br />
Take my wings and rely on them in battle and fight<br />
Fly on my dreams in the darkest of nights<br />
Put those wings of gold to the fear of your dreams<br />
And notice that what scares you is not always what it seems<br />
<br />
Okay, beneath my magnificent crown of tree<br />
I am being stained by dead bark and wounded twigs<br />
Yes, it makes black holes..., but it opens doors<br />
And that's what is giving me places for only a king to rule<br />
<br />
Join me<br />
We're all kings<br />
Don't fear for your insanity<br />
Fly on its wings<br />
<br />
Take my wings and rely on them in battle and fight<br />
Fly on my dreams in the darkest of nights<br />
Put those wings of gold to the fear of your dreams<br />
And notice that what scares you is not always what it seems<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="7">7. Ancient Entity</a></h3><br />
Beneath the fullmoon<br />
Covered in gloomy clouds<br />
Obscure funeral spirits<br />
Evil shadows on haunted ground<br />
<br />
Every night they rise again<br />
To meet the lords of death again<br />
They live on as souls in eternity<br />
Forced by an Ancient Entity<br />
<br />
Through the mist I see<br />
A circle around the gathered souls<br />
In the mist I do belive<br />
In sacred power of ancient kind<br />
<br />
Knights of Satan, dead boys choir<br />
Ten ore more around a fire<br />
Invoking dragons and demons this event<br />
They are not the ones that God has sent<br />
<br />
I heard them whisper...<br />
<br />
"As you reach the border to the unknown land,<br />
Or when you are visited by the great lords of darkness...<br />
Take your time, have in mind and remember...<br />
This is not supposed to be a comfortable land..."<br />
<br />
Every night they rise again<br />
To meet the lords of death again<br />
They live on as souls in eternity<br />
Forced by an Ancient Entity<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="8">8. The Southernmost Voyage</a></h3><br />
A sharpened shaft shines through morning dew<br />
Drawn out shadows walk on you<br />
Alone I stand to face the day<br />
Tortured by a deathly silent view<br />
<br />
Take my hand, please follow me<br />
I was your love and your destiny<br />
Let us over mistcovered mountains go<br />
To a place where our lost souls can be<br />
<br />
Not destined to a heaven built of lies and fantasy<br />
We will sail to the empire of ecstasy<br />
Travel through the back of out minds<br />
And soon forever dwell in necromancy<br />
<br />
The hall of Gods<br />
Where you belong<br />
If you have my blood<br />
And faith that strong<br />
<br />
May my words be engraved in the heart of every Man<br />
Try to understand them as good as you can<br />
"Drink to Lucifer or drink the blood of Christ<br />
All things are depending on your own dreamland"<br />
<br />
The hall of Gods<br />
Where you belong<br />
If you have my blood<br />
And faith that strong<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="9">9. Angels Far Beyond</a></h3><br />
Into the domain of wonderful throes<br />
Ended in swelled domes<br />
Like walking a tapered path<br />
Displaying every phase in life<br />
<br />
Angels are whispering from far beyond<br />
<br />
I step on hallowed ground<br />
Whereon rose clustered bouquets are thrown<br />
I look back at my past<br />
A lonely tear is running from my eye<br />
<br />
Angels are whispering from far beyond<br />
<br />
Golden flames burned out<br />
Like mighty men who left in delight<br />
Bizarre but still romantic<br />
Remains scattered in the air<br />
<br />
Angels are whispering from far beyond<br />
Dreaded in a beautiful way...<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="10">10. I Am The King (Of Dreams)</a></h3><br />
In the heat of the night<br />
I went to forever walk<br />
in the obscure eternity.<br />
Through woods and thickets,<br />
over mountains and through valleys.<br />
I left my body this evening<br />
and forever I will now live.<br />
Curious I travelled through an unknown land,<br />
like an angel that had recently learned to fly.<br />
I left my fear with my body<br />
and with the ravens I flew<br />
on a road, of bleeding clouds, that never seemed to end.<br />
As the road suddenly divided<br />
I heard the ravens whisper:<br />
"Please come, fly with us! Please come, fly with us!"<br />
Confused and insecure I stopped for a while<br />
and beheld the ravens disappear.<br />
Then I heard a voice from the other road:<br />
"This is the path to the golden land!<br />
Come my friend, take my hand!"<br />
But an uncontrolled voice deep in my soul<br />
screamed out: "I'll go my own way!"<br />
and straight ahead I flew, to continue my voyage<br />
and my search of the land of eternity.<br />
On the road I chose to go<br />
I saw no other men..., 'cause it was my own imagined road<br />
and I was alone to face its destination.<br />
What I saw around me were things I love.<br />
Things that I built with my heart, deep in myself.<br />
The temples I passed were my temples<br />
and the queen that welcomed me was my queen.<br />
My voyage was ended, and surrounded by the most<br />
beautiful flowers I stood beholding my kingdom<br />
I would rule in all the future to come.<br />
As the dawn of the morning swept through my dreamland<br />
to adorn the leafs of the golden trees with dew<br />
and to bring me eternal light, I thought:<br />
"A life is only worth living for a king..."<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="11">11. A Winter Shadow</a></h3><br />
Black, cold and dismal<br />
Sweeping through the nocturnal haze<br />
Led by the midnight breeze<br />
On its journey to its resting place<br />
<br />
A shadow out of time<br />
Hidden between different spheres<br />
Forsaken by memory<br />
To forever fly alone<br />
<br />
A Winter Shadow<br />
Under the haunted starlight<br />
Under the light of the moon<br />
Among stars so bright<br />
Delivered from Gods<br />
And cursed to an everlasting search<br />
<br />
Passed certain heavenly places<br />
Cried out at the gates of light<br />
No open door was seen<br />
Why it decided to assault<br />
<br />
At the throne of the Almighty<br />
It asked for hospitality<br />
But the hands of God<br />
Threw this stranger out<br />
<br />
A Winter Shadow<br />
Under the haunted starlight<br />
Under the light of the moon<br />
Among stars so bright<br />
Delivered from Gods<br />
And cursed to an everlasting search<br />
<br />
Time for a final step<br />
It searched through darkened space<br />
Ended the hellish gates stood proud<br />
<br />
But a shadow out of time<br />
Yet caught between spheres<br />
Is supposed to enter the night<br />
And forever fly alone...<br />
<br />
To forever fly alone...<br />
<br /><br />
