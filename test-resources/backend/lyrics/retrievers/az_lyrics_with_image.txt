Longing for silence...<br>
"Always faster" is the way that we go.<br>
Not a little patience...<br>
Higher, farer, better we grow.<br>
The beast is rising. It's tantalizing<br>
Those who are taking the time.<br>
Alienation... A revelation...<br>
Straight to the end of the line...<br>
<br>
Fly! Riding away... Rising today...<br>
No we don't play your headless game!<br>
We are alive, don't say goodbye.<br>
Fly! Riding away... Rising today...<br>
No we don't play your headless game!<br>
We are alive, don't say goodbye.<br>
<br>
Cast out from Eden...<br>
You don't like what we are in your eyes.<br>
We're leading the treason on the race you run,<br>
The way of your life.<br>
<br>
I am danger, I'm a stranger<br>
Cause I don't give in to your call.<br>
And not until she is satisfied<br>
We can come and explode and we fall!<br>
<br>
We're blowing the frame of your headless game:<br>
We don't follow!<br>
