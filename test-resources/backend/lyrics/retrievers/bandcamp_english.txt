you can tell<br>
by the scars on my arms<br>
and the cracks in my hips<br>
and the dents in my car<br>
and the blisters on my lips<br>
that i'm the carefullest of girls<br>
<br>
you can tell<br>
from the glass on the floor<br>
and the strings that are breaking<br>
and i keep on breaking more<br>
and it looks like i am shaking<br>
but it's just the temperature<br>
<br>
but then again<br>
if it were any colder i could disengage<br>
if i were any older i would act my age<br>
but i don't think you'd believe me<br>
it's not the way I'm meant to be<br>
it's just the way the operation made me<br>
<br>
and you can tell<br>
from the state of my room<br>
that they let me out too soon<br>
and the pills that i ate<br>
came a couple weeks too late<br>
and i've got some issues to work through<br>
there i go again<br>
pretending to be you<br>
make believing<br>
that i have a soul beneath the surface<br>
trying to convince you<br>
it was accidentally on purpose<br>
<br>
i am not so serious<br>
this passion is a plagiarism<br>
i might join your century<br>
but only on a rare occasion<br>
i was taken out before the labor pains set in<br>
and now behold the world's worst accident:<br>
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM<br>
<br>
and you can tell<br>
by the red in my eyes<br>
and the bruises on my thighs<br>
and the knots in my hair<br>
and the bathroom full of flies<br>
<br>
that i'm not right now at all<br>
there i go again<br>
pretending that i'll fall<br>
<br>
don't call the doctors cause<br>
they've seen it all before<br>
they'll say:<br>
"just let her crash and burn she'll learn<br>
the attention just encourages her"<br>
<br>
and you can tell from the full-body cast<br>
that you're sorry that you asked<br>
though you did everything you could<br>
like any decent person would<br>
but i might be catching so don't touch<br>
you'll start believing you're immune to gravity<br>
and stuff<br>
don't get me wet because the bandages will all come off<br>
<br>
and you can tell<br>
from the smoke at the stake<br>
that the current state is critical<br>
<br>
well it is<br>
the little things<br>
for instance:<br>
<br>
in the time it takes to break it<br>
she could make up ten excuses<br>
"please excuse her for the day<br>
it's just the way the medication makes her"<br>
<br>
i don't necessarily<br>
believe there is a cure for this<br>
so i might join your century<br>
but only as a doubtful guest<br>
i was too precarious<br>
removed as a caesarian<br>
behold the world's worst accident:<br>
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM<br>
