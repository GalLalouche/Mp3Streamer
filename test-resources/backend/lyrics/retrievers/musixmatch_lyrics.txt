Nobody knows everything<br>
We know this to be true<br>
Everything is difficult<br>
Except what's in front of you<br>
But it's complicated even under your nose<br>
Bullshit math equations<br>
And your highs and your lows<br>
And your manic depression<br>
It comes and it goes<br>
Your parasympathetic nervous system reacts<br>
And you're in fight-or-flight mode<br>
<br>
How's the world so small when the world is so large?<br>
And what made the world, could I please speak to who's in charge?<br>
Everything is real but it's also just as fake<br>
From your daughter's birthday party to your grandmother's wake<br>
And your bi-polar illness, it comes and it goes<br>
You parasympathetic nervous system reacts<br>
And you're in fight or flight<br>
You're in fight or flight<br>
You're in fight or flight mode<br>
<br>
I've tried to know which words to sing so many times<br>
And I've tried to know which chords to play<br>
And I've tried to make it rhyme<br>
And I've tried to find the key that all good songs are in<br>
And I've tried to find the notes to make that great resounding din<br>
<br>
But there's a bad man in everyone<br>
No matter who we are<br>
There's a rapist and a Nazi living in our tiny hearts<br>
Child pornographers and cannibals, and politicians too<br>
There's someone in your head waiting to fucking strangle you<br>
<br>
So here's to you, Mrs. Robinson<br>
People love you more, oh nevermind, oh nevermind<br>
In fucking fact, Mrs. Robinson<br>
The world won't care whether you live or die, live or die<br>
In fucking fact, Mrs. Robinson,<br>
They probably hate to see your stupid face, your stupid face<br>
So here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,<br>
You live in an unforgiving place.<br>
