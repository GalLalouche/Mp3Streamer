Falling through pages of Martens on angels<br>
Feeling my heart pull west<br>
I saw the future dressed as a stranger<br>
love in a space-dye vest<br>
<br>
Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding<br>
a pool in the shape of a heart<br>
Beauty projection in the reflection<br>
Always the worst way to start<br>
<br>

"But he's the sort who can't know<br>
anyone intimately, least of all a<br>
woman. He doesn't know what a woman<br>
is. He wants you for a possession,<br>
something to look at like a painting or an ivory box.<br>
Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real,<br>
or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you.<br>
I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and<br>
feelings, even when<br>
I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our<br>
last chance..."<br>
<br>
Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it<br>
Learning to swallow the rage<br>
Found a new girl I think we can make it<br>
as long as she stays on the page<br>
<br>
This is not how I want it to end<br>
And I'll never be open again<br>

"...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,<br>
get a job, get my own place, ummm,<br>
but... I go into the mall where I<br>
want to work and they tell me, I'm,<br>
I was too young..."<br>

"Some people, gave advice before,<br>
about facing the facts, about<br>
facing reality. And this is, this<br>
without a doubt, is his biggest<br>
challenge ever. He's going to have to face it.<br>
You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and,<br>
uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can<br>
say they know how he feels."<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.]</i><br>
"That, so they say that, in ya know<br>
like, Houston or something, you'd<br>
say it's a hundred and eighty degrees,<br>
but it's a dry heat.<br>
In Houston they say that?<br>
Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.<br>
Dry until they hit the swimming pool."<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]</i><br>
"...I get up with the sun... Listen.<br>
You have your own room to sleep in,<br>
I don't care what you do. I don't<br>
care when. That door gets locked,<br>
that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock.<br>
If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd<br>
better find some<br>
place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in<br>
this house.<br>
Supper is ready..."<br>
<br>
There's no one to take my blame<br>
if they wanted to<br>
There's nothing to keep me sane<br>
and it's all the same to you<br>
There's nowhere to set my aim<br>
so I'm everywhere<br>
Never come near me again<br>
do you really think I need you<br>
<br>
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.<br>
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.<br>
<br>
And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend<br>
And I'll never be open again<br>
And I'll have no more dreams to defend<br>
And I'll never be open again<br>
