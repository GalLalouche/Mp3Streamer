<i>[I. The Message]</i><br>
<br>
Pray for my soul<br>
Then hang me please<br>
Pray for my soul<br>
Then angels weep<br>
<br>
Who's to blame when it's all the same<br>
Remember I'm not the only one to warn you<br>
Behind the light, Crawls the night<br>
I live like the dead then die like the living<br>
<br>
What do you mean when you say you fear your fate?<br>
What do you mean when you say you know it's too late?<br>
<br>
I am so cold<br>
<br>
Will you fear the day to come?<br>
In the end blind I'll become<br>
Will you fear the day to come?<br>
In the end blind I'll become<br>
<br>
Death is empty, Death is filthy<br>
Death is cold, Death is somber<br>
Death is eternal, Death is certain<br>
Now the circle is closed<br>
I wish I was innocent enough to believe in such a fantasy<br>
I wish I was tamed enough to be pleased to keep living in this cage<br>
<br>
I feel cold...<br>
<br>

<i>[III. Doomsday]</i><br>
<br>
Will you fear the day to come?<br>
In the end blind I'll become<br>
Like I was warned<br>
What will it be?<br>
How will it be?<br>
