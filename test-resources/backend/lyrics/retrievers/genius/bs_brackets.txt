It was you and me and one hot summer<br>
Beading up with sweat all over each other<br>
Soaking wet<br>
We didn't have a lot of time<br>
So we didn't waste much<br>
Found in all the right places<br>
You wanted me to touch<br>
And all those memories<br>
Make it so hard to forget about me<br>
<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
Another chance to gain it just like that<br>
The best you ever had<br>
And do you close your eyes with her<br>
And pretend I'm doing you again<br>
Like only I can<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
<br>
It was you and me it seemed to last forever<br>
The way you taste and I still remember<br>
The sounds we made<br>
One day in June I stayed all night<br>
And made love to you like<br>
The fourth of July<br>
And all those memories<br>
Make it so hard to forget about me<br>
<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
Another chance to gain it just like that<br>
The best you ever had<br>
And do you close your eyes with her<br>
And pretend I'm doing you again<br>
Like only I can<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
<br>
Every night, every time<br>
You see me when you close your eyes<br>
<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
Another chance to gain it just like that<br>
Like only I can<br>
You wish you had me back<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
I bet you wish you had me back<br>
