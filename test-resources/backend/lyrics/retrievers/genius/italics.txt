I taste the broth that seeps down through the gorge<br>
I wipe the blade I once wrought from the forge<br>
The taste of flesh, the ash of oaken fires<br>
I bide my time by the mire until it dries<br>
<br>
To me the world is a heart<br>
No chambers void, some shallow<br>
And when the light prepares to depart<br>
A pulse for my breath to follow<br>
<br>
I sense the throes of twilight born anew<br>
I fear its wrath as all my brothers do<br>
Though life turns dark and movement steals the night<br>
I rejoice in the spoils at morning light<br>
<br>
To me the world is a heart<br>
No chambers void, some shallow<br>
And when the light prepares to depart<br>
A pulse for my breath to follow<br>
<br>
Retrieving senses dormant while daylight reigns<br>
<br>
The eyes of dusk ignite<br>
A promise of teeth and claw<br>
Revoke my bones from sleep<br>
Upon my tongue a feral howl<br>
<br>
Stars!<br>
Watchers of the dark<br>
Blood drips from my wailing plea<br>
Stars!<br>
I seek your blessing<br>
To paint the blood of my hunter<br>
Upon the weapon that reaps my prey<br>
<br>
To me the world is a heart<br>
No chambers void, some shallow<br>
And when the light prepares to depart<br>
A pulse for my breath<br>
A pulse for my breath to follow<br>
