Invisible bright man<br>
No sister slave on the marquee<br>
My lord may seem a lifeless ghost<br>
Though he'll never be quite dead to me<br>
<br>
Invisible bright man<br>
Need a better script -rainmaker's storm<br>
Unveil the end game sizzle<br>
Do away with these pathetic norms<br>
It’s time for my biggest season...<br>
<br>
I'm invisible bright man<br>
In lust with new misguided visions<br>
Weeping 'cause I want out<br>
Of mother's country...<br>
The sky is divine, the crow is hungry cherish my life 'cause it’s only a whisper...<br>
<br>
The heavy axe<br>
I see it falling<br>
Random acts<br>
I feel them coming on...<br>
<br>
Alter me<br>
I've maimed the tablature<br>
I've lost the guide posts<br>
But I’m not paranoid<br>
I'll pass on punishment<br>
Just street worship the pain<br>
Loosen my noose<br>
While no one is looking<br>
I'll just slip away...<br>
And pound the end -pound it hard<br>
Pound the end - pound it hard<br>
I'm invisible bright man<br>
Do I feel what I see?<br>
A familiar place called home<br>
As bad as bad can be<br>
Even a blind fool can move in these shadows<br>
I'll pull up a chair and love the light<br>
With my last breath...<br>
Invisible bright man. No one else can see<br>
I'm invisible bright man. I'm where I want to be<br>
Invisible bright man<br>
