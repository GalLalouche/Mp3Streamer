Just an urchin living under the street, I'm a<br>
Hard case that's tough to beat<br>
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat<br>
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line<br>
Rags and riches, or so they say, you gotta<br>
Keep pushing for the fortune and fame<br>
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game<br>
You treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doing the time<br>

Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah<br>
Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
Take me home<br>

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber<br>
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember<br>

I'd have another cigarette<br>
But I can't see, tell me who you're gonna believe<br>

Captain America's been torn apart, now<br>
He's a court jester with a broken heart<br>
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start"<br>
I must be losing my mind, are you blind? I've seen it all a million times<br>
<br>
Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
