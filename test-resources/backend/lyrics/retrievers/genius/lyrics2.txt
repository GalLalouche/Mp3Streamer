The boys who kiss and bite<br>
They are the brilliant ones who speak and write<br>
With silver luck<br>
They sing in clever tongues<br>
Oh, how my knees go weak to be the one<br>
She kicks and bucks<br>
<br>
(Always quick to follow)<br>
The boys are too refined<br>
(Won't matter tomorrow)<br>
Oh, to be in his mind<br>
<br>
And if the timing is right (Ohh)<br>
To sneak off into the night (Ohh)<br>
I'll let myself be taken just for the thrill<br>
And if I'm given the chance (Ohh)<br>
To be a doll in his hands (Ohh)<br>
I will be sure we shake the mountains while we dance<br>
<br>
To Daddy, singing sweet<br>
A lullaby to all his credit speak<br>
His golden light<br>
To the edge with a car<br>
He sent it off a cliff just for the spark<br>
To hell with why<br>
<br>
(Always quick to follow)<br>
The boys are too refined<br>
(Won't matter tomorrow)<br>
Oh, to be in his mind<br>
<br>
And if the timing is right (Ohh)<br>
To sneak off into the night (Ohh)<br>
I'll let myself be taken just for the thrill<br>
And if I'm given the chance (Ohh)<br>
To be a doll in his hands (Ohh)<br>
I will be sure we shake the mountains while we dance<br>
And if the timing is right (Ohh)<br>
To sneak off into the night (Ohh)<br>
I'll let myself be taken just for the thrill<br>
And if I'm given the chance (Ohh)<br>
To be a doll in his hands (Ohh)<br>
I will be sure we shake the mountains while we...<br>
<br>
And if the timing is right (Ohh)<br>
To sneak off into the night (Ohh)<br>
I'll let myself be taken just for the thrill<br>
And if I'm given the chance (Ohh)<br>
To be a doll in his hands (Ohh)<br>
I will be sure we shake the mountains while we dance<br>
