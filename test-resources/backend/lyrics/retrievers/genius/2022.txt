The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow<br>
Set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh<br>
Little while later the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow<br>
Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?<br>
<br>
There is a rusty light on the pines tonight;<br>
Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow, into the<br>
Bones of the birches, and the spires of the churches, jutting out from the shadows;<br>
The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks, and the bale, and the barrow—<br>
And everything sloped, like it was dragged from a rope, in the mouth of the south below<br>
<br>
We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey<br>
We thought our very hearts would up and melt away<br>
<br>
From that snow in the nighttime<br>
Just going and going<br>
<br>
And the stirring of wind chimes<br>
In the morning<br>
In the morning<br>
<br>
Helps me find my way back in<br>
From the place where I have been—<br>
<br>
And, Emily, I saw you last night by the river<br>
I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water—<br>
Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever<br>
In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I sat by your side, by the water<br>
You taught me the names of the stars overhead, that I wrote down in my ledger—<br>
Though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades, loosed in December<br>
I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember<br>
<br>
That the meteorite is the source of the light<br>
And the meteor's just what we see;<br>
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee<br>
And the meteorite’s just what causes the light<br>
And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;<br>
And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void, that lies quiet in offering to thee<br>
<br>
You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in;<br>
Threw the windows wide and cried, "Amen! Amen! Amen!"<br>
The whole world stopped to hear you hollering<br>
You looked down, and saw, now, what was happening:<br>
<br>
The lines are fading in my kingdom<br>
(Though I have never known the way to border them in);<br>
So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse, and the hen<br>
Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen<br>
And the mail is late, and the great estates are not lit from within<br>
The talk in town's becoming downright sickening<br>
<br>
In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare<br>
I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there<br>
<br>
And row through the nighttime<br>
So healthy<br>
Gone healthy all of a sudden<br>
<br>
In search of a midwife<br>
Who can help me<br>
Who can help me<br>
<br>
Help me find my way back in<br>
And there are worries where I've been<br>
And say, say, say, in the lee of the bay<br>
Don't be bothered<br>
Leave your troubles here<br>
Where the tugboats shear the water from the water<br>
(Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper)<br>
<br>
Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter<br>
And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I knew you better<br>
What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter<br>
<br>
Let us go! Though we know it's a hopeless endeavor<br>
The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined, and hold us close forever<br>
<br>
Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with<br>
A sky that is gaping and yawning<br>
There is a song I woke with on my lips<br>
As you sailed your great ship towards the morning<br>
<br>
Come on home. The poppies are all grown knee-deep by now<br>
Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow<br>
Peonies nod in the breeze<br>
And while they wetly bow<br>
With hydrocephalitic listlessness<br>
Ants mop up their brow<br>
<br>
And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour;<br>
The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours<br>
And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines—<br>
Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines<br>
<br>
Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight<br>
The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light<br>
<br>
Squint skyward and listen—<br>
Loving him, we move within his borders:<br>
Just asterisms in the stars' set order<br>
<br>
We could stand for a century<br>
Staring<br>
With our heads cocked<br>
In the broad daylight at this thing:<br>
<br>
Joy<br>
Landlocked in bodies that don’t keep—<br>
Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being<br>
Till we don’t be<br>
Told: take this<br>
Eat this<br>
<br>
Told: the meteorite is the source of the light<br>
And the meteor's just what we see;<br>
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee<br>
<br>
And the meteorite’s just what causes the light<br>
And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;<br>
And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee<br>
