Church blew up in Birmingham<br>
Four little black girls killed for no goddamn good reason<br>
All this hate and violence can't come to no good end<br>
A stain on the good name<br>
A whole lot of good people dragged through the blood and glass<br>
Blood stains on their good names and all of us take the blame<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in North Alabama, Wilson Pickett comes to town<br>
To record that sweet soul music, to get that Muscle Shoals sound<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in North Alabama, Aretha Franklin comes to town<br>
To record that sweet soul music, to get that Muscle Shoals sound<br>
<br>
And out in California, a rock star from Canada writes a couple of great songs about the<br>
Bad shit that went down<br>
"Southern Man" and "Alabama" certainly told some truth<br>
But there were a lot of good folks down here and Neil Young wasn't around<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in North Alabama, Lynyrd Skynyrd came to town<br>
To record with Jimmy Johnson at Muscle Shoals Sound<br>
And they met some real good people, not racist pieces of shit<br>
And they wrote a song about it and that song became a hit<br>
<br>
Ronnie and Neil Ronnie and Neil<br>
Rock stars today ain't half as real<br>
Speaking their minds on how they feel<br>
Let them guitars blast for Ronnie and Neil<br>
<br>
Now Ronnie and Neil became good friends their feud was just in song<br>
Skynyrd was a bunch of Neil Young fans and Neil he loved that song<br>
So He wrote "Powderfinger" for Skynyrd to record<br>
But Ronnie ended up singing "Sweet Home Alabama" to the lord<br>
<br>
And Neil helped carry Ronnie in his casket to the ground<br>
And to my way of thinking, us southern men need both of them around<br>
<br>
Ronnie and Neil Ronnie and Neil<br>
Rock stars today ain't half as real<br>
Speaking their minds on how they feel<br>
Let them guitars blast for Ronnie and Neil<br>
