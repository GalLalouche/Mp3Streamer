"Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."<br>
"And for what?"<br>
"Well, isn't it for the honor of God, Aunt Kate?"<br>
"I know all about the honor of God, Mary Jane."<br>
<br>
Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream<br>
Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop<br>
Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep<br>
And wood to chop before he sleeps<br>
<br>
I may never get over<br>
but never's better than now<br>
I've got bases to cover<br>
<br>
He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car<br>
It's nine o'clock but he can't get out<br>
He lights a cigarette<br>
and turns the music down<br>
but just can't seem to shake that sound<br>
<br>
Once I thought I'd get over<br>
but it's too late for me now<br>
I've got bases to cover<br>
<br>
Melody walks through the door<br>
and memory flies out the window<br>
and nobody knows what they want<br>
'til they finally let it all go<br>
<br>
The pain inside<br>
coming outside<br>
<br>
So many ways to drown a man<br>
So many ways to drag him down<br>
Some are fast and some take years and years<br>
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep<br>
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep<br>
<br>
I could never get over<br>
Is it too late for me now?<br>
Feel like blowing my cover<br>
<br>
Melody walks through the door<br>
and memory flies out the window<br>
and nobody knows what they want<br>
'til they finally let it all go<br>
<br>
But don't cut your losses too soon<br>
'cause you'll only be cutting your throat<br>
And answer a call while you still hear at all<br>
'cause nobody will if you won't<br>
