# Mp3Streamer
MP3 streamer backend and frontend, so I can listen to my music collection anywhere (In my defense, I started it before Spotify was a thing).

Backend is written in Scala + Play + Scalaz + Slick + RxScala + Guice + A bunch of other stuff.

Frontend is written in barebones HTML + TypeScript + JavaScript + jQuery + jQuery player, because I'm not a front-end developer.
